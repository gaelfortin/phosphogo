# About Phosphogo
Phosphogo is a set of tools to analyze phosphoproteomic data from mouse and human experiments. Kinase-substrate predictions can be performed using NetworKIN and IV-KEA (in vitro kinase enrichment analysis) in a user-friendly interface. Analyzing phosphoproteomic data without knowing how to code is now posible thanks to Phosphogo!

Phosphogo is written in [R](https://www.r-project.org/) 3.6.

Please cite **our paper** when using Phosphogo.
Get the latest updates of Phosphogo on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gaelfortin/phosphogo) of the project.

# Facing an issue?

If your problem is not fixed, please open an issue on our [GitHub issues portal](https://github.com/gaelfortin/phosphogo)!

# Phosphogo predictions softwares
Phosphogo relies on the following prediction strategies. Please cite their corresponding authors.
### NetworKIN
[Horn et al., KinomeXplorer: an integrated platform for kinome biology studies. Nature Methods 2014 Jun;11(6):603â€“4.](http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v11/n6/full/nmeth.2968.html)

### IV-KEA
Phosphogo uses the *in vitro* database published in:
